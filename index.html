  <p>I have three and half years of teaching experience in Mathematics. I worked in numerous colleges as an Assistant Professor and Lecturer. Details of these experiences are mentioned. 
I have received a certificate of recognition in the year 2011, by the University of Veer Narmad South Gujarat as a Post Graduate teacher which certified me capable of
teaching Mathematics to Post Graduate students (Master of Science).</br></br>

The most important lesson regarding teaching that I have learned in more than twenty year as a student and four years as a teacher is that the students we teach are no different than we
as students. They may be less motivated, less interested, or less adapt mathematically, but fundamentally they learn best in the same conditions that we do. As educators we need to
understand student motivation, interest, skills, adapt the content and pedagogy around them. </br></br>

I am currently in training to become an IT professional as a NPower Canada Program Participant in the Software Development and Testing Stream. This stream as defined by NPower organization is 
a 14 week exhaustive in-class training on the Software Development Languages, Technical, Life and Professional skills. </p>
